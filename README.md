  <h2>From ASO to Release, All Streamlined.</h2>
</div>

[AppAgent](https://app-agent.ai) is an AI-first tool that manages your app's ASO and release process. AppAgent is an open-source alternative to ASO tools, such as App Radar, AppTweak, AppFollow, and Sensor Tower. AppAgent is AI-first and works autonomously.

## Why AppAgent?

Thanks to rapid AI advancements, creating an app has never been easier. Yet popular ASO tools (App Radar, AppTweak, Sensor Tower, etc.) remain prohibitively expensive and unnecessarily complex for indie developers and small teams. What’s truly needed is a platform that autonomously handles everything—from multilingual keyword selection to ASO content generation—streamlining not just keywords, but the entire release process.

App Store Connect also introduced friction into the release workflow. That’s why I took an AI-first approach and built AppAgent from the ground up, reimagining how ASO and app releases should work together in one seamless, efficient platform.

## Getting Started

### Option A: Using devenv (Recommended)

[devenv](https://devenv.sh) provides a reproducible development environment with all dependencies pre-configured, including Node.js 22 and PostgreSQL 15.

#### 1. Install devenv

Follow the installation instructions at [devenv.sh/getting-started](https://devenv.sh/getting-started/).

#### 2. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngo275/app-agent.git
cd app-agent
```

#### 3. Start devenv services

```bash
devenv up
```

This will automatically start PostgreSQL 15 in the background. Keep this terminal running, or run it in detached mode with `devenv up -d`.

#### 4. Enter the devenv shell (in a new terminal)

```bash
devenv shell
```

This will automatically:

- Install Node.js 22 with npm
- Set up PostgreSQL 15 on port 5432
- Create the `aso` database with user `aso_user`
- Display version information for all tools

#### 5. Copy .env.sample to .env and change the values

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

The `DATABASE_URL` for devenv is:

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://aso_user:aso_password@127.0.0.1:5432/aso"
```

See the environment variables section below for other required values.

#### 6. Install dependencies and set up the database

```bash
yarn
yarn prisma generate
yarn prisma migrate deploy
```

#### 7. Run the development server

```bash
yarn dev
```
